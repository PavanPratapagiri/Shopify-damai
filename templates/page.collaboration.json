The brothers built a vertically integrated system that manages every step of the process - from gemstone sourcing to final quality control - ensuring consistency, efficiency, and fair wages for all. Their integrity was put to the test when a major U.S. retailer offered to buy them out; the brothers declined, choosing instead to remain independent and protect the creative freedom of their team.
